The aim is to offer a stimulating learning environment for undergraduate students, primarily through participating in engaging, practical laboratory work. In upper years, depending on one\'s interests, students can specialize in one of the more fundamental branches of the discipline, such as analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, or theoretical chemistry. Students can also choose to explore interdisciplinary applications, such as environmental, materials, biological, computational, or polymer chemistry.\r\n\r\nProfessional chemists play major roles in such diverse and important areas as the design and synthesis of pharmaceuticals and materials, the development of alternative energy sources, and the protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nNote: Students in this program are also eligible for the Queen’s Undergraduate Internship Program (QUIP) which provides 2nd or 3rd year students with a 12-16 month work experience.
